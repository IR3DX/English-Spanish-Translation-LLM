# AI Translator Web App
This repository provides a server-side implementation of a simple speech-enabled translation assistant powered by IBM Watson services. It transcribes English ( Or spanish ) audio, translates the text to Spanish ( Or English ) using a foundation model via IBM watsonx, and returns both the translated text and TTS speech.

## Overview
This application allows users to:

Speak an English/Spanish sentence.

Have it transcribed to text using Watson Speech-to-Text.

Translated to Spanish/English using the FLAN-UL2 foundation model from watsonx.

Returned both as written text and spoken Spanish/English audio using Watson Text-to-Speech.

The server exposes two main endpoints and supports interaction with a fullstack frontend (included as a .tar archive).

## Features
Speech Input: Users can speak directly to the interface using a microphone.

Natural Language Translation: Leveraging watsonx FLAN-UL2 foundation model for translating English sentences to Spanish.

Multimodal Output: Provides both textual and synthesized audio output of the translation.

API Integration: Interfaces with Watson's Speech-to-Text, Text-to-Speech, and foundation model APIs via IBM Cloud.
